. Unterscheidung between different types of large language models, such as transformer-based models, recurrent neural network (RNN) based models, and hybrid models. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each type of model, and provide examples of popular large language models that fall into each category.
Introduction:
Large language models have gained significant attention in recent years due to their impressive performance in a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data and can generate language that is often indistinguishable from human language. In this report, we will summarize the current state of large language models in 2024, distinguishing between different types of models based on their underlying architecture.
Transformer-based models:
Transformer-based models, such as BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet, are the most popular type of large language models. These models use a multi-head self-attention mechanism that allows them to parallelize the computation of attention across different parts of the input sequence. This allows them to process long sequences efficiently and generate high-quality language outputs.
